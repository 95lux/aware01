## Test calibration accuracy

- do calibration routine
- check pitch tracking by analyzing pitched sample:
    1. record sine at 1000Hz
    2. Insert 0V into V/Oct -> should result in original pb speed
    3. Insert 1V into V/Oct -> should result in +12st, so double frequency
    4. Insert 2V 
    5. Insert 3V

Evaluate tracking inaccuracy/drift in percentage
